You can check out the repositories with my code. I want to note that I continue to train and improve.

- I have a certificate and experience as a front-end developer.

- Thanks to the acquired skills, I strive to offer ways to the team
streamline and improve workflow, which in turn can
will positively affect the overall results of the project and reduce
load. I value personal qualities in communication
with management and subordinate staff. I managed it
to develop the ability to think creatively, quickly learn and find
important details. I have an irresistible desire for the global
development of the project I'm working on. I try every day
learn something new in programming. Every project gets better
my skills, because I try to use new technologies, improve
number of skills and increase the quality of coding. I have
experience in management positions.
